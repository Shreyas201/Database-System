# Global COVID-19 Vaccination Database System

### Overview
The project involves the development of a relational database model to store comprehensive data on global COVID-19 vaccinations. By integrating 9 CSV files containing diverse information related to vaccinations and connecting them through an ER diagram, a robust 7-table database is created. This database empowers policymakers and researchers to conduct in-depth analyses on vaccine rollout rates, pandemic outcomes, and global disparities in vaccine access.

### File Contents
`Database.sql`: contains SQL statements for designing the database schema.
`Vaccinations.db`: Database file containing imported dataset.
`Queris.sql`: Example SQL statements for specific tasks and data analysis.
`Model.pdf`: Document illustrating the database design.
